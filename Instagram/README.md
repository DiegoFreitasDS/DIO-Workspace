#This is a basic dev Front-end project. I recreated the landing page of instagram, using the knowledges of the basic lessons of HTML and CSS of the Digital Innovation One - DIO.

#The project was great for fixing some concepts such as: Flexbox, containers, positions, etc.

## The next steps are:
- Continuous studing
- Created new projects with more advanced features
- Graphical interface development

ENJOY THE PROCESS!
